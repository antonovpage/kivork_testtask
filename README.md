# Kivork Test Case

The application is a mobile utility for scanning documents. The monetization model is subscription, there is a trial period of 7 days with a further transition to payment of 4.99 USD per week.

#Task

1. Calculate the user's current LTV using cohort analysis (cohorting event - registration of a trial period, a cohort represents the number of possible operations).
2. Predict what LTV will be for six months.
3. Build a graph that will display the curve of the actual LTV on
against the curve of the predicted LTV.
4. Calculate ROMI for 4 weeks and for half a year, if the cost of attracting a paying user is 6 USD (ROMI should be taken operational, not accounting, the goal is to find out how our investments will pay off).
